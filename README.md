A SMT factory built in openGl 2.
This was developed as a assignment for university. My marks for this was 20/20
- Some assets were sourced from internet and other were given by the university.
- Some features include Wireframe: q, fast forward: f, close: 'Esc'

Use the vscode extention for cmake to build and run 


Else wise try
```bash
cmake --build .
```
